LetterJ02 = ["We expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion. Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance.  While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates.  When we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors: First, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4’18—placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1’18, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1’19, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations. Second, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Third, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained. Fourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. In addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. These last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I’d like to go a bit deeper on both. While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China’s smartphone market has been particularly sharp. Despite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace. Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year.  While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.  Many Positive Results in the December Quarter. While it’s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. Our installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high—growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it’s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. Also, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales.  Services generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020. Wearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth.  We also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam. Finally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple’s earnings per share. Looking Ahead Our profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time. As we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result.  Most importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas. We can’t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base.  This is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple’s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day. Expectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day. That has always been the Apple way, and it always will be."]

LetterJ29 = ["Thank you, Nancy. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter. So, the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month. As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago or down 3%, adjusting for foreign exchange. We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products, and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. One of those factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets was significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticipated. We'll return to upgrades in a moment. But I first wanna say a bit more about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Most of the shortfall relative to our original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide year-over-year revenue decline was driven by performance in greater China. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, western Europe, central and eastern Europe, and our rest of Asia-Pacific segment. We had record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Korea. In the letter we shared earlier this month, we said we were proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost. So, I wanna share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China. We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over two and a half million registered iOS developers. We saw very strong results from our wearables business there with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers. In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time. Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging December quarter, our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. Macroeconomic factors will come and go. But we see great upside in continuing to focus on the things that we can control. Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our results in the context of those lower than expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped. They share advanced technologies, including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with our next-generation neural engine capable of five trillion operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with stunning large, full-screen displays and face ID, the most secure authentication of any kind available in a smartphone. And the cameras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to allow users to create studio-quality photos as well as stunning 4k video, opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our iPhone lineup and our industry-leading customer satisfaction. We wouldn't change our position for anyone. Now, our customers are holding onto their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in I Phone revenue that was down 15% from last year. Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business grew strongly, by 19%. So, what's behind this? It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe it is the sum of several factors. First, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the US dollar has made our products more expensive many parts of the world. In Turkey, for example, the leer depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018. And in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year. Second, subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased the amount of subsidy during key periods. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in 1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies have come down as well. Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones some people have suggested that we shouldn't have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades. But we strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers. What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the many product categories and for all five of our geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing install base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing services business. In fact, services revenue set an all-time record of $10.9 billion in the December quarter, growing 19%. We not only generated our highest local services revenue ever. But we also had all-time records across multiple categories of services, including the app store, Apple Play, Cloud Services, and our app store search ad business. And we had a December quarter record for Apple Care. And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers. The app store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas day and Christmas week ever. Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day, alone, setting a new single-day record for both the number of customers and purchase volume. It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter well over twice the volume of the year-ago quarter. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3000 speedway locations while all Target, Taco Bell, and Jack stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon. We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter: Germany, Belgium, and Kazakhstan. And it's now live in 27 markets around the world. The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, software, and ecosystem with our engaged and active user base. Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay. And it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life. Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the three countries where we've launched, the United States, the UK, and Australia. Here in the US, the latest data from COMM scores shows that Apple News has the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will continue to grow with our first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this quarter. In summary, we are very happy not only with the growth but also the breadth of our services portfolio. Our revenue from services has grown from less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. The largest category represents less than 30% of total services revenue. And the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth. We had our best quarter ever from Mac revenue which was up 9%, fueled by our new MacBook Air and Mac mini, introduced in October. The MacBook Air includes a beautiful new retina display, touch ID, and forced touch trackpad while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything from home automation to giant render forms. iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by the new iPad Pro, released in November. With its edge to edge liquid retina display, face ID, and A12X bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful mobile device ever made. We also had our best quarter ever for wearables, home, and accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from wearables thanks to strong sales above Apple Watch and AirPods. We don't measure our success in 90-day increments. We manage Apple for the long-term. And when we consider the keys to our success over time, there are three that stand out: our highly satisfied and loyal customers, our large and growing active installed base, and, at the heart of it all, our deeply ingrained culture of innovation. Thanks to all this, our ecosystem is stronger than ever before. We have an amazingly talented team creating hardware, software, and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. Apple Watch is a powerful example of that. It's humbling to read emails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions, such as AFib, and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS. We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities. Another example is the work we're doing with Silicone. We've embedded machine learning directly into the Silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom neural engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transactions directly on the device. This means iPhone can recognize patterns, make predictions, and learn from experience. And it does all this while keeping personal information private. This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand in hand at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users. We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic conditions to improve. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in an iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity. It's not only great for the environment. It's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone. And it's great for developers as a phone that is traded in and redistributed can help grow our active install base. Beginning last week, we started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments. And we're working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as we can. We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. And we have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year. Apple innovates like no other company on earth. And we are not taking our foot off the gas. We'll continue to invest through near-term headwinds, just as we always have. And we'll emerge stronger as a result. Now, for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca."]

Guard13 =  ["The chief executive of Apple acknowledged the growing alarm about the companys struggling stock price on Wednesday, but did little to answer questions about its product plans and how best to return cash to shareholders. Tim Cook, speaking at the technology giant's annual meeting in Cupertino, California, beat off a shareholder revolt over executive pay and defended the company's performance. But he gave few details about near-term plans except for a project to build a futuristic new headquarters by 2016. A third of shareholders voted against the company's plans for executive pay, although it was not enough to block the package. Cook received a 51percent increase in pay to $1.4m in base salary and $4.17m in compensation this year. In 2011, his stock awards were worth over $378m. Chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer, who was paid $1.4m last year, benefited from an a $68.6m pay package, mostly made up of stock awards. The issue of executive remuneration has become particularly inflamed because of Apple's falling stock price and its first dip in profits for over a decade. Cook addressed the sharp slide in Apple's stock price, which has lost 30 percent of its value in only five months. I don't like it either, Cook said. Neither does the board or management, but we're focused on the long term. Rumours had swirled for days before the meeting that Apple would split its stock or announce a plan to return some of its $137bn pile cash to shareholders. One analyst at Oracle Investment Research, Laurence Balter, released a report arguing that Apple should split its stock to temporarily raise the stock price. None of that happened, although Cook said the company was in talks about plans for the cash. The rumours provided a temporary boost to the company's stock price. But the lack of any substantive action resulted in a fallback: Apple's stock was down 0.25% to $447.86 in afternoon trading on Wednesday. Apple shares peaked at $705 in September last year, but they have since declined amid concerns hat there is no new breakthrough product in the pipeline, and in the face of intense competition from Samsung and other smartphones using Google's Android operating system. The declining share price has led to calls for Apple to share more of its $137bn mountain of cash and securities. The demands are being spearheaded by outspoken hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who has launched a lawsuit to force Apple to pay out some of its cash. Cook said again on Wednesday that Einhorn's lawsuit was a silly sideshow. The underlying principle of cash distribution was something he and the board took seriously, he added. Einhorn was not spotted at the meeting on Wednesday, but Cook repeated that the company's board remained in very very active discussions about options for cash sharing. Michael Yoshikami, the CEO of Destination Wealth Management and an Apple shareholder, said he was not surprised that the company was relatively quiet about its plans. Apple has never used its shareholder meetings to break news, and in the past, late CEO Steve Jobs rarely even attended the gatherings. I absolutely did not expect him to say anything substantive, Yoshikami said of Cook. This is not where news will be made, but people were so desperate for news that they were hoping that something would come out of the shareholder meeting that was shocking and exciting.Howard Lindzon, the founder of StockTwits and an Apple shareholder, also did not hold out much hope that the meeting would turn the tide in Apple shares. Come on, there's nothing that he could said at this meeting. He needed to act, Lindzon said of Cook. People are going to sell the stock – he says he doesn't care, and he should. He has to listen. It's not just a bunch of day traders complaining any more. Lindzon said he was disappointed at the amount of money he lost on Apple stock this year. I own enough that I feel like a dummy,. It's made so much and it's created so much loyalty that i just want to see an end of the drama here." ]


nyt13 = ["Apple on Wednesday reported the kind of quarter most big companies would envy, posting a profit of $13.1 billion and selling 28 percent more iPhones and 48 percent more iPads, its two biggest products. Its stock sank 11 percent Thursday. What is going on? Because of its great success in recent years, many investors have come to expect nothing short of perfection from Apple. And while it is still widely considered the most innovative company in the technology world, a maker of products that its devoted customers cannot live without, Apple is facing a range of challenges. It is dealing with increased competition from big rivals like Samsung and Google, and with so many people already using smartphones, the market is not quite as untapped as it once was. Apple is forging into cheaper product categories, meaning lower profit margins. And given that Apple has grown so big, with sales of more than $160 billion in the last 12 months, keeping up its heady growth rate is becoming harder and harder. Once-euphoric investors, who pushed Apple stock to a record high of $702.10 last September, have become nervous, and in early trading on Thursday, the stock traded at $455.89, down more than 34 percent from its peak. Apple has reinvented itself several times over the last decade with groundbreaking new products, and could do so again. Television and electronic payments are among the markets where analysts believe the company could make a push, leading it to new heights. Apple has really been able to invent whole new markets,” said John Gallaugher, an associate professor at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. “That’s where it differs from companies like Microsoft. I don’t think the mojo of this team has evaporated. In a conference call with analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the company’s pipeline of new products was “chock-full.” “We feel great about what we have in store,” he said, without adding details. In the meantime, though, the love affair that investors once had with Apple is clearly waning. “There’s nothing that can help the stock from sliding now,” said Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, who said Apple’s holiday sales met his own forecasts, even though they missed others’ predictions. Editors’ Picks Why Is My Sleep So Messed Up in the Summer Why Buy Anything You Could Borrow (Especially If You’re Renting) ‘And Just Like That …’ has an Obsession With Logos For years, Apple has offered an unusual alchemy: it was not only a large, highly profitable tech company, but one with the rapid growth rate of a start-up. It pulled this off under the leadership of Steven P. Jobs, its former chief executive, who died in late 2011. He had a startling knack for finding new multibillion-dollar opportunities for Apple with the iPod, iPhone and iPad, but his death has accentuated concerns about the company’s prospects. A big part of Apple’s challenge is that it is now so large that it seems unrealistic, mathematically, for the company to continue finding new pots of gold big enough to maintain its growth. In a recent research report, A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research, calculated that were Apple to grow for the next five years at the same rate as the last five years, its revenue would be $1.2 trillion, or about the size of Australia’s gross domestic product. One continuing concern is that the iPhone, which accounts for over half of Apple’s revenue, could be smothered by smartphones running Google’s Android operating system, which accounts for three out of every four handsets shipped globally. But Apple continues to take an outsize portion of the profits in the smartphone business, and in the United States the company actually increased its share of the smartphone market over the holiday quarter, rising to 51.2 percent from 44.9 percent a year earlier, according to a study released this week by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. On Wednesday, Apple did not appear to provide a strong enough reason for investors to warm to it again. It said its profits were flat because of higher manufacturing costs, even as revenue rose 18 percent. Apple’s net income for its fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 29 was $13.1 billion, or $13.81 a share, flat compared with $13.1 billion, or $13.87 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue was $54.5 billion, up from $46.33 billion a year ago. Those results compared to the average estimates of $13.44 a share earnings and revenue of $54.73 billion from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Apple’s growth in the quarter looked anemic compared with the huge numbers it used to deliver. For the holiday quarter of 2011, in contrast, its revenue jumped 73 percent and its profit soared 118 percent. In its financial forecasts for the current quarter, Apple provided numbers that suggest a decline of roughly 20 percent in earnings a share, according to Mr. Sacconaghi’s calculations. A number of analysts say they still believe the company’s good times are not over. “Sentiment has turned super-pessimistic on Apple, where they’ve gone from being able to do no wrong to suddenly being able to do no right,” said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “I tend to think the company’s momentum is a heck of a lot more solid than people are concerned about.” One factor that hurt comparisons between Apple’s most recent holiday quarter and the previous one was that its 2012 quarter was a week shorter. Headed into the holiday quarter, analysts were worried about Apple’s profit margins, which the company had warned would decline as a result of a near total overhaul of the company’s product line. While new products are routine for a company like Apple, it said the number of devices it released around the holidays, like the iPhone 5, iPad Mini and new Mac computers, was unusual. But negative sentiment has further hardened amid reports that Apple had cut orders for components with a supplier, potentially suggesting weak demand for the iPhone. Mr. Cook cautioned that investors shouldn’t place too much significance on such reports because Apple often gets its parts from multiple sources."]
